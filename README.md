## LFSR
# Linear-Feedback Shift Register
This short verilog module is an 8-bit random generator, which creates a noise-like output in time.
You can easily edit the Seed numbers and use the module multiple times in your project. 
The whole idea of the code is super simple, therefore you ca also edit the properties of the output once you read the code completely.
I needed a simple-fast module like this in one of my recent projects, and since the quick need for it is very common, I made it public.
